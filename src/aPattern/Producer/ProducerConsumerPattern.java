//Benefit of Producer Consumer Pattern
//Its indeed a useful design pattern and used most commonly while writing 
//multi-threaded or concurrent code.here is few of its benefit:
//1)Producer Consumer Pattern simple development.you can Code Producer 
//and Consumer independently and Concurrently,they just need to know 
//shared object.
//2)Producer doesn'tneed to know about who is consumer or how many consumers 
//are there.Same is true with Consumer.
//3)Producer and Consumer can work with different speed.There is no risk of 
//Consumer consuming half-baked item.In fact by monitoring consumer speed one 
//can introduce more consumer for better utilization.
//4)Separating producer and Consumer functionality result in more clean,
//readable and manageable code.
//Producer Consumer Problem in Multi-threading
//Producer-Consumer Problem is also a popular java interview question where 
//interviewer ask to implement producer consumer design pattern so that 
//Producer should wait if Queue or bucket is full and Consumer should wait 
//if queue or bucket is empty.This problem can be implemented or solved by 
//different ways in Java,classical way is using wait and notify method to 
//communicate between Producer and Consumer thread and blocking each of them on 
//individual condition like full queue and empty queue.With introduction of 
//BlockingQueue Data Structure in Java 5 Its now much simpler because 
//BlockingQueue provides this control implicitly by introducing blocking 
//methods put()and take().Now you don'trequire to use wait and notify to 
//communicate between Producer and Consumer.BlockingQueue put()method will 
//block if Queue is full in case of Bounded Queue and take()will block if 
//Queue is empty.In next section we will see a code example of Producer 
//Consumer design pattern.
