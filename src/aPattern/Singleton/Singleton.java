//Why Singleton is Anti pattern 
//
//With more and more classes calling getInstance() the code gets more and more 
//tightly coupled, monolithic, not testable and hard to change and hard to reuse 
//because of not configurable, hidden dependencies. Also, there would be no need 
//for this clumsy double checked locking if you call getInstance less 
//often (i.e. once).
