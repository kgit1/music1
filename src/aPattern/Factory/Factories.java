//pattern Factory - creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal
//with problem of creating objects without having to specify exact class
//of the object that will be created
//we give some object as argument and method knows on his own what to 
//do when get object of that class

//When to use Factory design pattern in Java
//Static Factory methods are common in frameworks where library code needs 
//to create objects of types which may be sub classed by applications using 
//the framework.Some or all concrete products can be created in multiple ways,
//or we want to leave open the option that in the future there may be new ways 
//to create the concrete product.Factory method is used when Products don't need 
//to know how they are created.We can use factory pattern where we have to 
//create an object of any one of sub-classes depending on the data provided
